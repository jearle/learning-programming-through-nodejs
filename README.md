# Learning Programming Through Node.JS

This book will teach you how programming can be useful to the non programmer for automating redundancies in your every day life.  The tools we will be using are JavaScript and Node.JS.  

## Why Learn to Program?

It's simple, programming improves your quality of life by automating tedium and removing redundancy.  I want to show you how unscary the process of writing programs can be.

Writing programs doesn't necessarily mean writing the next operating system, video game or the next social network.

If you're a designer, you could write a program that automates exporting pngs/jpgs from PSDs.  If you're a security expert, you can create a lightweight program that parses text files.  If you're a cashier, you could write a program that calculates sale prices for left over halloween candy.

If you're a student you could even write a program that calculates the answers to your math homework.  This may sound like cheating, but it actually reinforces your understanding of the mathematical concepts.  Plus, you have a means to verify your answers without the aid of a teacher.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is the most prevasive language on the planet.  Learning how to write applications using this language has a low barrier to entry for beginners and is a skill that transends mediums.  This means you can write server side applications, desktop applications, mobile applications, command line applications and web applications using the same set of technologies and methodologies.

## Why Node.JS?

Node.JS is consistent across all major operating systems and provides a great way to share programs.

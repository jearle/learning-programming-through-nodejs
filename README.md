# Learning Programming Through Node.JS

JavaScript is the most prevasive language on the planet.  Learning how to write applications using this language has a low barrier to entry for beginners, and is a skill that transends mediums.  This means you can write server side application, desktop application, mobile applications, command line applications and web applications using the same set of technologies and methodologies.

Writing an application doesn't necessarily mean writing the next Facebook or Angry Birds.  You can write a simple program to automate some repetive task you do on a daily basis.  For example you could automate generating emails from a template, balance your budget, or calculate what the date will be 67 days from now.  You can even write a program that calculates the answer's to your homework.  While this may seem like cheating, it's actually forcing you to actually understand how the math works, as you're essentially writing a proof, while simultaneously giving you a means in which to check your work without the aid of a teacher or professor.  Beautiful.

Learning how to write even the simpliest of programs provides you freedom from large clunky applications that are either too general or too specific.  Programming enables you to create exactly what you need.

Math allows you to understand quanity, structure, space and change.  Language allows you to communicate complex ideas to other human beings.  Programming allows you to automate both.  This allows you to focus on concepts, over moving details.

# Learning Programming Through Node.JS

This book will teach you how programming can be useful to the non programmer for automating redundancies in your every day life.  The tools we will be using are JavaScript and Node.JS.  

## Why Learn to Program?

It's simple, programming improves your quality of life by automating tedium and removing redundancy.  I want to show you how unscary the process of writing programs can be.

Writing programs does not need to mean writing the next operating system, the next social network, or even the next brochure-like web page.

If your a designer, you could write a program that automates exportings pngs/jpgs from PSDs.  If your a security expert, you can create a lightweight program that parses text files.  If your a cashier, you could write a program that calculates sale prices for all that left over halloween candy.

If your a student you could even write a program that calculates the answer's to your math homework.  This may sound like cheating, but it's actually forcing you to understand how the math works.  Plus, you have a means to verify your answers without the aid of a teacher.  Beautiful.

## Why JavaScript

JavaScript is the most prevasive language on the planet.  Learning how to write applications using this language has a low barrier to entry for beginners, and is a skill that transends mediums.  This means you can write server side application, desktop application, mobile applications, command line applications and web applications using the same set of technologies and methodologies.

## Why Node.JS

Node.JS is consistent across all major operating system and sharing software is extremely painless.

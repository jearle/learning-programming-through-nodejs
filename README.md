# Learning Programming Through Node.JS

JavaScript is the most prevasive language on the planet.  Learning how to write applications using this language has a low barrier to entry for beginners, and is a skill that transends mediums.  This means you can write server side application, desktop application, mobile applications, command line applications and web applications using the same set of technologies and methodologies.

Writing an application doesn't necessarily mean writing the next Facebook or Angry Birds.   Programming can mean automating simple daily tasks.  You can generate repetive emails, balance your budget, or calculate what the date will be 67 days from now.

You can even write a program that calculates the answer's to your math homework.  This may sound like cheating, but it's actually forcing you to understand how the math works.  Plus, you have a means to verify your answers without the aid of a teacher.  Beautiful.

Learning how to write even the simpliest of programs provides you freedom from large clunky applications that are either too general or too specific.  Programming enables you to create exactly what you need.

Math allows you to understand quanity, structure, space and change.  Language allows you to communicate complex ideas to other human beings.  Programming enables the automation of both, freeing your focus from details to the much more imporant conceptual understanding of your problem.
